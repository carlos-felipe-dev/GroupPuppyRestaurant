- Challenge - “Puppy Restaurant”
- This is a project where we built out a fully functional website based on a preexisting prototype that was provided for us. We built the website to be as close to pixel-perfect of the prototype, while also designing responsiveness for mobile and tablet versions of the website from scratch.
